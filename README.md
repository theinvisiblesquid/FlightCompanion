# FlightCompanion

FlightCompanion hopes to be a personal flight tracker for people with antennas listening on 1090Mhz.

It is a 3-part applicaiton, the Linux script for the node picking up ADS-B data, a backend server using MySQL, and an Android application for displaying live flight information.

I also hope to be able to implement statistics and historical flight tracking.
